# Hi there, I'm Peters Muditha! 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an **Aspiring Junior Cybersecurity Technical Writer** with a passion for making complex security concepts easy to understand for everyone. I believe that clear documentation is the first line of defense in cybersecurity.

- 🛡️ **Focus & Hands-on Learning:**

    - **Networking:** Analyzing the OSI model, TCP/IP layers, and secure/plaintext networking protocols.
    - **Cryptography & Hashing:** Implementing symmetric/asymmetric encryption (RSA, SSH) and hash-cracking with tools like John the Ripper.
    - **Exploitation & Web Hacking:** Leveraging real-world vulnerabilities
      
- ✍️ **Writing:** Documenting hands-on labs from TryHackMe and OverTheWire.
- 🚀 **Goal:** To bridge the gap between technical complexity and user accessibility.

### 🛠️ Skills in Progress
